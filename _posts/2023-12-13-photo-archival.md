Preserving photographs is a cool thing to do. Today, photos are very disposable so it can be easy to forget their worth. Photography is a form of memory and can often serve to sustain a moment in time far better than the mind. Physical objects are impermanent and it is lucky we have what we do. In a wake of anxiety of losing memories I did not have, either because I forget things or I didn't exist, I decided to scan every possible thing I could find in the summer of 2022. Digitising analogue photography takes a while but is an incredibly satisfying and worthwhile process.

I bought myself a scanner, a CanoScan LiDE 300 to be precise. It is incredibly fun to use, and I recommend anyone reading to buy a scanner for yourself (or borrow mine!) Below is a record of photo albums, sorted, more often than not, how I found them scattered about my house or my Nan's flat. Click on the photos to be taken to pages where these photo albums are linked - I've sorted them into: [Mum's photos](https://ekulrf.github.io/lukes-letters/photo-mum/), [Nan's photos](https://ekulrf.github.io/lukes-letters/photo-nan/), [Family photos](https://ekulrf.github.io/lukes-letters/photo-familyDrawers/), [Dad's photos](https://ekulrf.github.io/lukes-letters/photo-dad/).

Enjoy!
